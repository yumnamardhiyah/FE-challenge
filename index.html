                            <h3>1. Prague, Czech Republic</h3>
                            <p class="content"> With its snow-capped spires and cobbled, winding streets, Prague is a fairytale city that remains relatively tourist-free in winter.
                                The stunning architecture looks even prettier under a sheet of snow, with one of the most beautiful areas being the old town,
                                with its turrets and Romanesque vaults. Gas street lamps have been reinstalled throughout the city center, adding a romantic hue to evenings.
                                Cafes here are ideal for escaping the bitter cold. "Choco Cafe is a great place to take a breather from intense winter sightseeing in the Old Town,"
                                says travel blogger Girl in Czechland. "It's full of comfy chairs and sofas and they have more than a dozen kinds of hot chocolate,
                                which is so thick you can practically stand a spoon up it in it."
                            </p>
                            <h3>2. Salzburg, Austria</h3>
                            <p class="content"> With its backdrop of Christmas carols and traditional markets, this is a perfect city for a winter break. 
                                "Silent Night" was performed for the first time in the Oberndorf on the outskirts of Salzburg on Christmas Eve in 1818.
                                The city's main market is held in the shadow of Salzburg's Hohensalzburg fortress, but the one held in Mirabell Square is especially popular 
                                with foodies who come to sample local delicacies such as halusky -- pieces of dumpling mixed with fried bacon. <br><br>

                            <p class="content">I-15 runs from San Diego to Montana, carving off the westernmost quarter of the country from the rest.
                                The best stretch to drive, though, is the chunk between Utah to Nevada.</p>
                            <h3>Overseas Highway: Miami to Key West</h3>
                            <p class="content">Driving down the Overseas Highway from Miami to Key West feels like slowly decompressing from the world at large. (The Seven Mile Bridge will make you feel like youâ€™re soaring over the water.) 
                                The necklace of islands strung together by this 127.5-mile road vary markedly, moving from the Upper Keys, which seem like shards of the mainland cast off into the ocean, 
                                on to the Middle and Lower Keys. The final stop is Key West, a.k.a the Conch Republic.</p>
